        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Your privacy is very important to us. As a result, we have created this privacy policy in order for you
            to understand how we collect, use, or disclose your data. Our privacy policy is outlined below for your
            review.</p>
        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>The Interior Harvest is a full-service fine firm of interior designers known for offering
            high-quality furnishings and remodelling or designing of rooms. Our website is
            <u><i>www.interiorharvest.com</i></u></p>
        <h3>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h3>
        <p>We collect the information that you provide to us. Before or at the time of collecting your personal
            information, we will identify and disclose why we are collecting the information and will only use that
            information to fulfill our disclosed objective unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned.
            We retain that personal information as long as needed to fulfill the disclosed objective. We will
            collect the information by lawful and fair means and will do our best to maintain the personal data with
            reasonable security safeguards against unauthorized disclosure, copying or use. We will continue to make
            our policies available to our customers.</p>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
            visitorâ€™s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>
        <p>An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar
            service to see if you are using it. You can check the Gravatar service privacy policy.
            After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the
            public in the context of your comment.</p>
        <h3>Media</h3>
        <p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF
            GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the
            website.</p>
        <h3>Contact / Subscription forms</h3>
        <p>We ask for basic contact information from you in our forms in order to contact you back and address any
            comments or concerns that you may have when contacting us. The type of information that we collect
            depends on the form that you are completing; however, none of the information provided will be used
            outside our already stated purposes.</p>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
            cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you
            leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
        <p>If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.
            This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>
        <p>If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie
            includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires
            after 1 day.</p>
        <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
        <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
            content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other
            website.</p>
        <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and
            monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the
            embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
        <h3>Who we share your data with</h3>
        <p>Your data may be shared with third party payment processing and payment gateways to complete your
            purchase such as PayPal. Your information is encrypted and will only be stored long enough to complete
            the transaction. Any additional third party providers used by us will only collect, use, or disclose
            your personal information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to
            us. All of these third party services and partners have their own privacy policies, so we recommend that
            you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will
            be handled by these service providers.</p>
        <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
        <p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
            recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
            queue.</p>
        <p>For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in
            their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except
            they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
        <h3>What rights you have over your data</h3>
        <p>If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file
            of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request
            that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep
            for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>
        <p>You can withdraw your consent and opt out of all communication by unsubscribing from our emails, or
            contacting us at <u><i>info@interiorharvest.com</p></u></i></p>
        <h3>Where we send your data</h3>
        <p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service. We may disclose your
            personal information if we are required by law to do so if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
